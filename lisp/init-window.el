;;; init-window.el --- Working with window within frames -*- lexical-binding: t -*-
;;; Commentary:
;; This file configures Emacs "window" â€” the panels within a frame that
;; display buffers. It provides:
;;   - Window layout management (winner-mode)
;;   - Window switching enhancements (switch-window)
;;   - Split windows with other-buffer behavior
;;   - Toggle delete/restore other windows
;;   - Toggle window dedication
;;   - Save/restore window configurations
;;; Code:

;; ----------------------
;;; Enable winner-mode
;; ----------------------
;; Winner mode allows undo/redo of window configurations with C-c <left> / C-c <right>
(winner-mode 1)

;; ----------------------
;;; Switch window
;; ----------------------
;; Use switch-window to display overlays in each window when switching.
;; Makes "C-x o" easier to use when multiple windows exist.

                         #'switch-window--other-window-or-frame)))

;; ----------------------
;;; Split windows with other buffer
;; ----------------------
;; Provides a wrapper to split a window and display the "other buffer"
;; in the new window. Optionally select the new window unless ARG is non-nil.

;; ----------------------
;;; Dedicated window toggle
;; ----------------------
;; Makes the current window "dedicated" to its buffer or un-dedicated.
;; A dedicated window won't be reused by `display-buffer`.

;;; Save / restore window configurations

;; Stack-based saving and restoring of window layouts.
;; Useful for temporary layouts or experiments with window splits.
